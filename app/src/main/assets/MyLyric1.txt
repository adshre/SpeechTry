Hey I was doing just fine before I met you
I drink too much and that's an issue but I am okay
Hey you tell your friends it was nice to meet them
But I hope I never see them again
I know it breaks your heart
Moved to the city in a broke down car
And four years, no calls
Now you are looking pretty in a hotel bar
And I can not stop
No I can not stop
So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover
That I know you can not afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder
Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of the mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder
We are not ever getting older
