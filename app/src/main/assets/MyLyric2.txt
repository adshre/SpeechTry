We do not talk anymore we don't talk anymore
We do not talk anymore like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for
Oh we don't talk anymore like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you have been looking
You have been looking for
I wish I would have known that was not me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can not move on
Just the way you did so easily
Do not wanna know
What kind of dress you are wearing tonight
If he is holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should have known your love was a game
Now I can not get you out of my brain
Oh it is such a shame
